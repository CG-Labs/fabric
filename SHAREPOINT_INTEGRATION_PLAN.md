# SharePoint Integration Plan for the `fabric` Project

## Overview

This document outlines a conceptual integration plan for leveraging the `fabric` project's AI capabilities within a SharePoint environment. The goal is to apply the `fabric` project's patterns and commands to business tasks and documents stored in SharePoint, enabling users to summarize documents, analyze claims, and extract insights.

## Dependencies

The following libraries are required for interacting with SharePoint:
- `Office365-REST-Python-Client`
- `msal`

These libraries are already listed as dependencies in the `poetry.lock` file of the `fabric` project.

## Environment Setup

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install Office365-REST-Python-Client msal
   ```

2. Set up the necessary environment variables for authentication and API access:
   ```bash
   export CLIENT_ID="your_client_id"
   export CLIENT_SECRET="your_client_secret"
   export TENANT_ID="your_tenant_id"
   export SHAREPOINT_SITE_URL="your_sharepoint_site_url"
   ```

## Use Cases and Workflows

### 1. Summarizing SharePoint Documents

**Objective:** Provide concise summaries of lengthy SharePoint documents for quick review.

**Workflow:**
1. Retrieve the document content from SharePoint using the `Office365-REST-Python-Client`.
2. Use the `fabric` project's `summarize` pattern to generate a summary of the document content.
3. Store the summary back in SharePoint or present it to the user.

**Example Code:**
```python
from office365.sharepoint.client_context import ClientContext
from office365.runtime.auth.client_credential import ClientCredential
import subprocess

# Authentication
client_credentials = ClientCredential(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET)
ctx = ClientContext(SHAREPOINT_SITE_URL).with_credentials(client_credentials)

# Retrieve document content
file_url = "/sites/your_site/Shared Documents/your_document.docx"
file = ctx.web.get_file_by_server_relative_url(file_url).get().execute_query()
file_content = file.read().decode('utf-8')

# Summarize document content using fabric
summary = subprocess.run(["fabric", "--pattern", "summarize"], input=file_content, text=True, capture_output=True).stdout

# Store summary back in SharePoint or present to user
print(summary)
```

### 2. Analyzing Claims in SharePoint Reports

**Objective:** Evaluate the veracity of statements within SharePoint-stored reports.

**Workflow:**
1. Retrieve the report content from SharePoint using the `Office365-REST-Python-Client`.
2. Use the `fabric` project's `analyze_claims` pattern to evaluate the claims in the report.
3. Store the analysis results back in SharePoint or present them to the user.

**Example Code:**
```python
from office365.sharepoint.client_context import ClientContext
from office365.runtime.auth.client_credential import ClientCredential
import subprocess

# Authentication
client_credentials = ClientCredential(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET)
ctx = ClientContext(SHAREPOINT_SITE_URL).with_credentials(client_credentials)

# Retrieve report content
file_url = "/sites/your_site/Shared Documents/your_report.docx"
file = ctx.web.get_file_by_server_relative_url(file_url).get().execute_query()
file_content = file.read().decode('utf-8')

# Analyze claims in report using fabric
analysis = subprocess.run(["fabric", "--stream", "--pattern", "analyze_claims"], input=file_content, text=True, capture_output=True).stdout

# Store analysis results back in SharePoint or present to user
print(analysis)
```

### 3. Extracting Insights from SharePoint Content

**Objective:** Distill key insights from SharePoint content for decision-making.

**Workflow:**
1. Retrieve the content from SharePoint using the `Office365-REST-Python-Client`.
2. Use the `fabric` project's `extract_wisdom` pattern to extract key insights from the content.
3. Store the extracted insights back in SharePoint or present them to the user.

**Example Code:**
```python
from office365.sharepoint.client_context import ClientContext
from office365.runtime.auth.client_credential import ClientCredential
import subprocess

# Authentication
client_credentials = ClientCredential(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET)
ctx = ClientContext(SHAREPOINT_SITE_URL).with_credentials(client_credentials)

# Retrieve content
file_url = "/sites/your_site/Shared Documents/your_content.docx"
file = ctx.web.get_file_by_server_relative_url(file_url).get().execute_query()
file_content = file.read().decode('utf-8')

# Extract insights from content using fabric
insights = subprocess.run(["yt", "--transcript", "https://youtube.com/watch?v=uXs-zPc63kM", "|", "fabric", "--stream", "--pattern", "extract_wisdom"], input=file_content, text=True, capture_output=True).stdout

# Store extracted insights back in SharePoint or present to user
print(insights)
```

## Conclusion

This integration plan provides a conceptual framework for leveraging the `fabric` project's AI capabilities within a SharePoint environment. By following the outlined workflows, users can enhance their productivity and decision-making processes through automated summarization, claim analysis, and insight extraction from SharePoint-stored documents.
