# AI Bot Inference Pseudocode

## Overview
This document outlines the pseudocode for the AI bot "Hal" to infer user requests and select the correct commands based on the patterns available in the `fabric` project. The bot will analyze user input, map it to the appropriate pattern, and execute the command to provide the desired output.

## Pseudocode

### Function: infer_user_request
```python
def infer_user_request(user_input):
    """
    Infer the user's request based on the input provided.

    Args:
        user_input (str): The input provided by the user.

    Returns:
        str: The name of the pattern that matches the user's request.
    """
    # Analyze the user input to determine the intent
    # Map the user input to the appropriate pattern
    # Return the name of the pattern
    pass
```

### Function: run_command
```python
def run_command(pattern_name, user_input):
    """
    Run the command corresponding to the specified pattern.

    Args:
        pattern_name (str): The name of the pattern to execute.
        user_input (str): The input provided by the user.

    Returns:
        str: The output generated by the pattern.
    """
    # Execute the script corresponding to the pattern
    # Process the user input and generate the output
    # Return the output
    pass
```

### Main Loop
```python
def main():
    """
    Main loop for the AI bot to continuously listen for user input,
    infer the request, and run the appropriate command.
    """
    while True:
        # Listen for user input
        user_input = listen_for_input()

        # Infer the user's request
        pattern_name = infer_user_request(user_input)

        # Run the command and get the output
        output = run_command(pattern_name, user_input)

        # Provide the output to the user
        provide_output_to_user(output)

        # Handle exceptions and provide feedback
        handle_exceptions()
```

## Example Usage
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Notes
- The `infer_user_request` function should use natural language processing techniques to analyze the user input and determine the intent.
- The `run_command` function should execute the corresponding script from the `patterns` directory and process the user input to generate the output.
- The main loop should continuously listen for user input, infer the request, run the command, and provide the output to the user.
- Exception handling should be implemented to provide meaningful feedback to the user in case of errors or unclear requests.
