# Pull Request: AI Bot Integration

## Overview
This pull request introduces the initial pseudocode and documentation for the AI bot "Hal" to infer user requests and select the correct commands based on the patterns available in the `fabric` project. The bot will analyze user input, map it to the appropriate pattern, and execute the command to provide the desired output.

## Changes
- Added `AI_BOT_INFERENCE_PSEUDOCODE.md`:
  - Drafted pseudocode for the AI bot "Hal" to infer user requests and select the correct commands.
  - Defined functions `infer_user_request` and `run_command`.
  - Outlined the main loop for the bot to continuously listen for user input, infer the request, and run the appropriate command.

## Next Steps
- Implement the `infer_user_request` and `run_command` functions with appropriate logic for natural language processing and command execution.
- Integrate the AI bot with Microsoft Teams.
- Conduct thorough testing and validation.
- Create detailed documentation and a user guide.

## Notes
- The `infer_user_request` function should use natural language processing techniques to analyze the user input and determine the intent.
- The `run_command` function should execute the corresponding script from the `patterns` directory and process the user input to generate the output.
- Exception handling should be implemented to provide meaningful feedback to the user in case of errors or unclear requests.

Please review the changes and provide feedback.
